Known Issues:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The tiles are not perfectly centered in their rows.
- Multiple tiles can be hit by one keystroke.
- Currently, there is no pause from game start to the time when the tiles start appearing on the game board.
- By not pressing restart and instead simply pressing run, a game that a player has already lost can be continued.
- The game does not speed up over time.
